# What is HTML Boilerplate

An **HTML Boilerplate** includes a basic structure for an HTML document, like the typical *html*, *head*, and *body* tags, as well as links to CSS and JavaScript files. It may also include some basic CSS stylings, such as stylings to reset or normalize code which helps improve consistency between renderings in different browsers, and may include some basic JavaScript functionality, such as a responsive navigation menu or form validation.


## The components of HTML Boilerplate
HTML Boilerplate typically includes the following components:

1. **HTML**: The markup language used to structure the content of a website.
2. **CSS**: The language used for styling and layout of a website. This is optional.
3. **JavaScript**: A programming language used for adding interactivity and dynamic functionality to a website. This is also optional.

The HTML elements commonly found within an HTML boilerplate typically encompass:

`<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used, in this case, HTML5.
`<html lang="">`: The <html> tag defines the root of an HTML document and contains all other HTML elements.
`<head>`: This tag contains information about the document, such as the title, metadata, and links to ***CSS and JavaScript files***, that is not displayed in the main body of the web page.
`<meta charset="UTF-8">`: This tag defines the character encoding for the document, in this case, *UTF-8. UTF-8* is a commonly adopted character encoding that supports a wide range of characters from different languages and scripts.
`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: This tag sets the viewport, which is the area of the browser window used to display the web page.
`<title>`: This tag defines the title of the web page, which is displayed in the browser tab or title bar.
`<body>`: This tag contains the main content of the web page, such as headings, text, images, videos, links, and buttons.
